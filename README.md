# NoFuture.py: A future-less Discord bot (Python version)
Look, I'll give it to you straight: This is a general-purpose, do-whatever-you-want kind of bot, it has no specific goal and is mostly there
so I can practice programming and not get bored out of my mind with infrastructure at work.

This bot's name, possibly its avatar picture too (in the original instance that I maintain, that is) and a lot of other things make references
towards Free from Soul Eater (credits to ÅŒkubo-sensei for that awesome manga). If you haven't given the show a read or a watch, you likely 
won't understand much, so just bear with the silly references here.

The idea for the bot's name is that a bot with no purpose has no future.\
Simple as that.

Some of the code you see here (especially core.utils and Roger) was yoinked off my other bot, [Daedalus](https://github.com/yuriel-v/Daedalus).

### To-do list:
* Add a future
* Add ChanServ-like mockery for moderation
* ~~Yoink Roger commands from Daedalus~~ done! :godmode:
* Add YouTube/Google Image search functions
