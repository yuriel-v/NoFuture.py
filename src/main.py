"""
NoFuture.py: A future-less Discord bot (Python version)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Look, I'll give it to you straight: This is a general-purpose,
do-whatever-you-want kind of bot, it has no specific goal and is mostly there
so I can practice programming and not get bored out of my mind with
infrastructure at work.

This bot's name, possibly its avatar picture too (in the original instance that
I maintain, that is) and a lot of other things make references towards Free
from Soul Eater (credits to ÅŒkubo-sensei for that awesome manga). If you
haven't given the show a read or a watch, you likely won't understand much.

The idea for the bot's name is that a bot with no purpose has no future.
Simple as that.

And yes, the text above is the original one that I moved to README.md.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file in particular has the core stuff and the bot's setup/main event loop.
Cogs in particular go into their respective categories under ./cogs/category.
